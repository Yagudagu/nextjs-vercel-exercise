      One of our customers recently wanted to download data from our cloud portal in csv format, so they could do some comparison work for a DR exercise. Unfortunately, our portal doesn't have this feature. I asked around in company slack channels and found that other customers had been experiencing the same issue. In response, they had developed a prototype of a native client tool that allows customers to download details from their tenancies. With their permission, I gained access and provided that tool to the customer. I also had to quickly learn that tool, so that I could help the customer implement.</p>
